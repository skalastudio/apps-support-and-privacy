One calendar. Always in sync.

### Promotional Text
Create one reliable calendar from all your accounts. Unified Calendar Sync keeps events updated automatically and privately on your Mac.

### Description
Unified Calendar Sync is a lightweight macOS menu bar app that creates and maintains a dedicated unified calendar acting as your single source of truth.
The app syncs events from multiple calendar accounts into a user-selected target calendar, keeping events updated over time and preventing duplicates.
Because events are written into a standard calendar chosen by the user, such as iCloud, synced events remain visible wherever that calendar is accessible.
It works seamlessly with the calendars already configured on your Mac, including iCloud, Exchange, CalDAV, and subscribed calendars, with all processing done locally.

Key features:
- Creates a dedicated unified calendar as a single source of truth
- Syncs events from multiple accounts into one maintained calendar
- Keeps events visible across devices via the selected target calendar
- Automatically updates events when changes are detected
- Smart deduplication to prevent duplicates over time
- Preserves titles, dates, locations, notes, and alarms
- Automatic and manual sync options
- Menu bar app that is always available and never intrusive
- Fully local processing with no servers and no tracking
